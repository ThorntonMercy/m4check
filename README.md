Module 4 HTML Knowledge Check 

The assignment was to create a basic webpage with
1. A navigation bar.
2. One product table with pricing and quantity  columns, and a minimum of 3 products.
3. One image, with a bonus option of including one with a rounded edge styling.  
4. One contact form that collects the name, email, and message of the user. There was a bonus option of including a “how did you find us” section utilizing radio buttons.

For this project, I decided to do a little extra practice as it’s been a long while since I’ve played with HTML/CSS and I really just wanted to take a couple extra minutes to test my memory.

I outlined the webpage in a way that makes the most sense given the basic structure of the content. I used the navigation bar first, of course. I then added the product table, with four products. I named this section “About.” 

The next section was not given a name, as I wasn’t sure exactly the extent of our creative liberty so I didn’t want to add a fourth link. (Otherwise this section would be named something like Gallery.) This is where the three images are laid. I chose to have them stacked on top of each other instead of side by side, as visually they don’t match. I was not sure if the second image needed to be something we picked or if it was just supposed to be the placeholder again, so I opted to add two rounded images.

The next section of the page is named “Contact” and that’s where our form is. It begins with the required contact information (name, email, message) and has the radio buttons to select how the page was found.

Extra elements I’ve added includes a reset form button, a return to the top of the page (“Home”) link underneath the contact form, and a footer. I also changed the body background color, added styling to the table, and added styling to certain paragraphs to align them center or right.
